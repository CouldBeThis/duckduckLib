# DuckDuckLib

A Firefox (and probably Chrome) extension that allows the user to search DuckDuckGo with safe search disabled and regional filters turned off. No other settings included. 

<!-- Check it out on [the Firefox Add-ons site](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/duckduckgo-safe/). -->

Based on [duckduckgo-safe](https://github.com/AdamVig/duckduckgo-safe) by AdamVig, which does the exact opposite.

## useage notes

the omnibox search iss `ddl` so you can have regular duckduckgo installed concurrently. 

info re omnibox for [developers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/WebExtensions/manifest.json/omnibox)
