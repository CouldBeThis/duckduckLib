# DuckDuckLib

[toc]

## introduction

A Firefox extension that allows the user to search DuckDuckGo in a way which is identical to the usual DuckDuckGo search with two main exceptions:

1. **"Safe search" is disabled.** This is the main point of the extension. There will be one less algorithm deciding for you what is appropriate viewing. 

   Of course you may always use the [Safe Search page](https://safe.duckduckgo.com/) or change the settings on a per-search basis if for some reason you want this function. Read [about safe search](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/features/safe-search/).

2. **Region-specific results are disabled**. Can be enabled on a per-search basis. Read [about regional search](https://help.duckduckgo.com/duckduckgo-help-pages/settings/regions/).

You do not need this extension to accomplish either of these goals. It is merely a convenience.

## useage notes

### <!--Icon-->

<!--The **icon** used in the search bar is *slightly* different, so they it may be visually distinguished from the original.--> 

<!--Original DuckDuckGo icon-->

<!--DuckDuckLib icon-->

<!--![dax-logo-lib-16](/Volumes/Five-Counter/CouldBeThis/duckducklib/icons/ddl-icon-16.png)-->

### omnibox search

the omnibox search is `ddl` so you can have regular duckduckgo (`ddg`) installed concurrently without interfering with it's behaviour. 

### Privacy

This extension merely formats your request from the location/search box to include the parameters described above DuckDuckGo. The information does not go anywhere else, or do anything other than it otherwise would.
